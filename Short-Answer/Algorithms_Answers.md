#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I


a) O(n). This one is deceptive and seems like O(n^3). However, it will only run until it hits it limit.


b) O(n^2). This example shows a nested for loop which means the n/input is being looped over two times every single run of the function. The runtime will become slower as the size of n increases exponentially.



c)  0(n). Recursive functions allow the input to only have to be looped through one time; keeping the runtime fast even as n increases in size



## Exercise II

n-story building, plenty of eggs

egg breaks n-story >= f
egg ! break n-story < f

value of f
number of dropped + broken eggs is minimized
