#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I


a) O(n^5)



b) O(n^2). This example shows a nested for loop which means n/input is being looped over two times every single run. This will increase n exponentially



c)  0(n). Recursive functions allow the input to only have to be looped through one time; keeping the runtime fast even as n increases in size



## Exercise II
